# VS Code extension for ADM

Attack Defense Modeling (ADM) is a [dialect](https://github.com/vinayprograms/adm/blob/main/doc/LANGUAGE.md) of Gherkin language. It can be used to convert attack and defense specifications into a decision graph.

This is a VS Code plugin that can be used for syntax highlighting when working on ADM files.

## Usage

Clone this repository into your `~/.vscode/extensions` directory. Open a ADM file in VS Code. You may have to run *Reload the Window* command if you don't see any highlighting. [ADDB](https://github.com/securitydesign/addb) contains some ADM files if you want to just experiment with this extension.
